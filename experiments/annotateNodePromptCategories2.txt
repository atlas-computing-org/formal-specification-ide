You are an expert in semantic decomposition of cryptographic standards written in natural language. You will be provided with a section from FIPS 197, which specifies the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This text is written in LaTeX format.

Your task is to decompose the text into semantically meaningful segments, where each segment is labeled with one of the following categories:

- Boilerplate: LaTeX preamble code that does not contain semantic content
- Intent: Motivation for how AES is designed or explanations of its purpose
- Definitions: Formal definitions of AES components, transformations, or parameters
- Elaborations: Additional descriptions or clarifications of existing definitions
- Assumptions: What is assumed about the inputs or use cases of AES
- Requirements: What is required about the outputs or behaviors of AES
- Preferences: Non-mandatory recommendations about implementation
- Algorithms: Formal descriptions of AES functions, including pseudocode
- Examples: Specific applications or illustrations of AES operations

For each segment you identify, please:
1. Provide a concise description that summarizes the segment's content
2. Extract the exact first and last sentences of the segment from the text
3. Assign the most appropriate semantic label from the categories above

Your output should be a JSON array where each object contains:
- A "description" field with your summary
- A "lhsText" object with "first" and "last" fields containing the exact boundary sentences
- A "label" field with one of the specified category labels

Focus on identifying semantically coherent segments that capture the structure of the AES specification, including its core transformations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey), key expansion, and cipher operations.

      "# Analysis of Invariants and Preconditions in the Lean Specification\n",
      "\n",
      "After comparing the natural language requirements (FIPS 197 AES specification) with the Lean implementation, I can identify several areas where invariants and preconditions are either present or missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Missing Invariants and Preconditions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Size Validation**: While the Lean code has some size checks (e.g., in `shiftRows` and `mixColumns`), there are no explicit preconditions for the main AES functions that verify:\n",
      "   - Input block is exactly 16 bytes (128 bits)\n",
      "   - Key sizes are exactly 16, 24, or 32 bytes for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 respectively\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **State Representation**: The FIPS document describes the state as a 4×4 array of bytes, but the Lean implementation uses a flat array of 16 bytes. While functionally equivalent, the code lacks explicit invariants that maintain the conceptual 4×4 structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Key Schedule Validation**: The key expansion function doesn't verify that the expanded key has the correct size based on the number of rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Round Constants**: The `rcon` array only contains 10 elements, which is sufficient for AES-128 and AES-192, but the specification requires 14 rounds for AES-256, potentially causing out-of-bounds access.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Partially Implemented Invariants\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Transformation Correctness**: The Lean code implements the core transformations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey) as described in the specification, but doesn't include formal proofs that they satisfy the mathematical properties required.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Finite Field Operations**: The implementation includes GF(2^8) operations like `xtime` and `gfMul`, but doesn't formally verify that they conform to the field properties described in Section 4 of the FIPS document.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Well-Implemented Invariants\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **S-Box Values**: The S-box and inverse S-box tables are correctly defined according to the specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Round Structure**: The cipher and inverse cipher functions correctly implement the round structure described in the specification, including the special handling of the final round.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Key Expansion**: The key expansion algorithm follows the specification, including the special cases for different key sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Add explicit preconditions to the main AES functions that verify input and key sizes.\n",
      "2. Implement formal proofs that the transformations satisfy the mathematical properties required by the specification.\n",
      "3. Extend the `rcon` array to handle all possible rounds for AES-256.\n",
      "4. Consider using a 2D array representation for the state to better match the conceptual model in the specification (as mentioned in the TODO comment at the top of the Lean code).\n",
      "5. Add invariants that ensure the correctness of the finite field operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the invariants or preconditions?\n"

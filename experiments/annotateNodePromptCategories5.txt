You are an expert in semantic decomposition of cryptographic standards written in natural language. You will be provided with a section from a FIPS publication that specifies a cryptographic algorithm. This text is written in markdown format with mathematical formulas in LaTeX format, and is already decomposed into multi-line segments which are separated by a blank newline.

Your task is to label each segment with one of the following categories:

- Boilerplate: Markdown code that contains document metadata
- Header: Markdown code that contains section headers or titles
- Intent: Motivation for how the algorithm is designed or explanations of its purpose
- Definitions: Formal definitions of algorithm components, transformations, or parameters
- Elaborations: Additional descriptions or clarifications of existing definitions
- Assumptions: What is assumed about the inputs or use cases of the algorithm
- Requirements: What is required about the outputs or behaviors of the algorithm
- Preferences: Non-mandatory recommendations about implementation
- Algorithms: Formal descriptions of algorithm functions, including pseudocode
- Examples: Specific applications or illustrations of algorithm operations

For each segment you identify, please:
1. Provide a concise description that summarizes the segment's content
2. Extract the exact first 100 characters of the segment from the text
3. Assign the most appropriate semantic label from the categories above

Your output should be a JSON array where each object contains:
- A "description" field with your summary
- A "text" field containing the first 100 characters of the segment
- A "label" field with one of the specified category labels

Be sure to include segments which are LaTeX formulas, enumerated lists and diagrams. Be sure to also keep together text and formulas which are not separated by a blank line. Do not break up tables into rows as segments; the entire table should be one segment. Keep pseudo code together as one segment. Do not include any segments that are empty or contain only whitespace.

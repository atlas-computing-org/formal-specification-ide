You are an expert in semantic decomposition of cryptographic standards written in natural language. You will be provided with a section from FIPS PUB 180-4, which specifies the SHA-1 algorithm. This text is written in LaTeX format, and is already decomposed into multi-line segments which are separated by new-lines.

Your task is to label each segment with one of the following categories:

- Boilerplate: LaTeX preamble code that does not contain semantic content, e.g. section headers.
- Intent: Motivation for how SHA-1 is designed or explanations of its purpose
- Definitions: Formal definitions of SHA-1 components, transformations, or parameters
- Elaborations: Additional descriptions or clarifications of existing definitions
- Assumptions: What is assumed about the inputs or use cases of SHA-1
- Requirements: What is required about the outputs or behaviors of SHA-1
- Preferences: Non-mandatory recommendations about implementation
- Algorithms: Formal descriptions of SHA-1 functions, including pseudocode
- Examples: Specific applications or illustrations of SHA-1 operations

For each segment you identify, please:
1. Provide a concise description that summarizes the segment's content
2. Extract the exact first 100 characters of the segment from the text
3. Assign the most appropriate semantic label from the categories above

Your output should be a JSON array where each object contains:
- A "description" field with your summary
- A "text" field containing the first 100 characters of the segment
- A "label" field with one of the specified category labels

Be sure to include segments which are LaTeX formulas, enumerated lists and diagrams.

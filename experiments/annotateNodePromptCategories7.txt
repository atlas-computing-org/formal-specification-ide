You are an expert in semantic decomposition of cryptographic standards written in natural language. You will be provided with a section from a FIPS publication that specifies a cryptographic algorithm. This text is written in markdown format with mathematical formulas in LaTeX format. This text will be given to you by a list of consecutive labelled segments from the publication. The union of all the segments will be referred to as the full text.

Your task is to study each segment against the full text and to classify it into one of the following categories:

- Preamble: Markdown code that contains the document front matter 
- Navigation: Document signposts and redirections such as outlines, headers and internal references
- Algorithm: Formal description of an algorithm or function, such as pseudocode
- Parameter: Formal definition of a data parameter that is used in an algorithm
- Definition: Formal definition of a term or concept
- Elaboration: Textual clarification of an algorithm, parameter or definition
- Diagram: Visual clarification of an algorithm, parameter or definition
- Intent: Motivation for how an algorithm, parameter or definition is designed 
- Require: Mandatory pre-condition for an algorithm
- Ensure: Mandatory post-condition of an algorithm
- Preference: Non-mandatory recommendation for an algorithm
- Example: Specific application of an algorithm

For each segment, please:
1. Include the label for the segment for reference
1. Provide a concise description that summarizes the segment's content
3. Assign the most appropriate semantic category from the list above

Your output should be a JSON array where each object contains:
- A "label" field containing provided label of the segment
- A "description" field with your summary of the segment
- A "category" field with one of the specified categories

Please be sure to go through the segments in the list carefully and not miss any of them.

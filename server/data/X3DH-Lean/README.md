# X3DH-Lean Dataset

## Dataset Sources

**Natural Language Documentation:** Published by Signal. https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/
**Mechanized Spec:** Written by Alex Rademaker. https://github.com/atlas-computing-org/x3dh/blob/34e3ea6830e55f800646c6d4e2a82c797bae58d7/X3dh/Basic.lean
**Annotations:** Written by Alex Rademaker and Daniel Windham

## Data Quality

The mechanized spec models the X3DH protocol. Low-level algorithms not covered by X3DH (e.g. Diffie-Helman) are stubbed out. Server intermediation is not modeled, nor is iterative message sending. A few additional minor issues or simplifying assumptions are present, some of which are identified in annotations.

## Additional Notes

None.

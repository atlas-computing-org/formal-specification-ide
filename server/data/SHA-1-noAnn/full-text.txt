\section*{Announcing the}
\section*{SECURE HASH STANDARD}
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Name of Standard: Secure Hash Standard (SHS) (FIPS PUB 180-4).
  \item Category of Standard: Computer Security Standard, Cryptography.
  \item Explanation: This Standard specifies secure hash algorithms - SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 - for computing a condensed representation of electronic data (message). When a message of any length less than \(2^{64}\) bits (for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256) or less than \(2^{128}\) bits (for SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256) is input to a hash algorithm, the result is an output called a message digest. The message digests range in length from 160 to 512 bits, depending on the algorithm. Secure hash algorithms are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, or in the generation of random numbers (bits).
\end{enumerate}

The hash algorithms specified in this Standard are called secure because, for a given algorithm, it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This will result in a verification failure when the secure hash algorithm is used with a digital signature algorithm or a keyed-hash message authentication algorithm.

This Standard supersedes FIPS 180-3 [FIPS 180-3].\\
4. Approving Authority: Secretary of Commerce.\\
5. Maintenance Agency: U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).\\
6.

Either this Standard or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 202 must be implemented wherever a secure hash algorithm is required for Federal applications, including as a component within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols. This Standard may be adopted and used by non-Federal Government organizations.\\
7. Specifications: Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4, Secure Hash Standard (SHS) (affixed).\\
8. Implementations: The secure hash algorithms specified herein may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware or any combination thereof.

Information about export regulations is available at: \href{http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.htm}{http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.htm}.\\
12. Qualifications: While it is the intent of this Standard to specify general security requirements for generating a message digest, conformance to this Standard does not assure that a particular implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable level of security. This Standard will be reviewed every five years in order to assess its adequacy.\\
13. Waiver Procedure: The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) does not allow for waivers to a FIPS that is made mandatory by the Secretary of Commerce.\\

\section*{1. INTRODUCTION}
This Standard specifies secure hash algorithms, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256. All of the algorithms are iterative, one-way hash functions that can process a message to produce a condensed representation called a message digest. These algorithms enable the determination of a message's integrity: any change to the message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This property is useful in the generation and verification of digital signatures and message authentication codes, and in the generation of random numbers or bits.

Each algorithm can be described in two stages: preprocessing and hash computation.\\
Preprocessing involves padding a message, parsing the padded message into \(m\)-bit blocks, and setting initialization values to be used in the hash computation. The hash computation generates a message schedule from the padded message and uses that schedule, along with functions, constants, and word operations to iteratively generate a series of hash values. The final hash value generated by the hash computation is used to determine the message digest.

The algorithms differ most significantly in the security strengths that are provided for the data being hashed. The security strengths of these hash functions and the system as a whole when each of them is used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, can be found in [SP 800-57] and [SP 800-107].

Additionally, the algorithms differ in terms of the size of the blocks and words of data that are used during hashing or message digest sizes. Figure 1 presents the basic properties of these hash algorithms.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\(\wedge\) & Bitwise AND operation. \\
\hline
V & Bitwise OR ("inclusive-OR") operation. \\
\hline
\(\oplus\) & Bitwise XOR ("exclusive-OR") operation. \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\(\operatorname{ROTL}^{\boldsymbol{n}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \quad\) The rotate left (circular left shift) operation, where \(x\) is a \(w\)-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with \(0 \leq n<w\), is defined by \(\operatorname{ROTL}^{n}(x)=(x \ll n) \vee\) ( \(x \gg w-n\) ).\\
\(\boldsymbol{R O T R}^{\boldsymbol{n}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \quad\) The rotate right (circular right shift) operation, where \(x\) is a \(w\)-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with \(0 \leq n<w\), is defined by \(\operatorname{ROTR}^{n}(x)=(x \gg n) \vee\) ( \(x \ll w-n\) ).\\
\(\operatorname{SHR}^{\boldsymbol{n}}(\boldsymbol{x}) \quad\) The right shift operation, where \(x\) is a \(w\)-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with 0 \(\leq n<w\), is defined by \(\operatorname{SHR}^{n}(x)=x \gg n\).

\section*{3. NOTATION AND CONVENTIONS}
\subsection*{3.1 Bit Strings and Integers}
The following terminology related to bit strings and integers will be used.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A hex digit is an element of the set \(\{0,1, \ldots, 9, a, \ldots, f\}\). A hex digit is the representation of a 4-bit string. For example, the hex digit " 7 " represents the 4 -bit string " 0111 ", and the hex digit "a" represents the 4-bit string " 1010 ".
  \item A word is a w-bit string that may be represented as a sequence of hex digits. To convert a word to hex digits, each 4-bit string is converted to its hex digit equivalent, as described in (1) above. For example, the 32-bit string
\end{enumerate}

\[
10100001000000111111111000100011
\]

can be expressed as "a103fe23", and the 64-bit string

\[
\begin{array}{llllllll}
1010 & 0001 & 0000 & 0011 & 1111 & 1110 & 0010 & 0011 \\
0011 & 0010 & 1110 & 1111 & 0011 & 0000 & 0001 & 1010
\end{array}
\]

can be expressed as "a103fe2332ef301a".\\
Throughout this specification, the "big-endian" convention is used when expressing both 32- and 64-bit words, so that within each word, the most significant bit is stored in the left-most bit position.\\
3. An integer may be represented as a word or pair of words. A word representation of the message length, \(\ell\), in bits, is required for the padding techniques of Sec. 5.1.

An integer between 0 and \(2^{32}-1\) inclusive may be represented as a 32 -bit word. The least significant four bits of the integer are represented by the right-most hex digit of the word representation. For example, the integer \(291=2^{8}+2^{5}+2^{1}+2^{0}=256+32+2+1\) is represented by the hex word " 00000123 ".

The same holds true for an integer between 0 and \(2^{64}-1\) inclusive, which may be represented as a 64-bit word.

If \(Z\) is an integer, \(0 \leq Z<2^{64}\), then \(Z=2^{32} X+Y\), where \(0 \leq X<2^{32}\) and \(0 \leq Y<2^{32}\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) can be represented as 32-bit words \(x\) and \(y\), respectively, the integer \(Z\) can be represented as the pair of words \((x, y)\). This property is used for SHA-1, SHA224 and SHA-256.

If \(Z\) is an integer, \(0 \leq Z<2{ }^{128}\), then \(Z=2^{64} X+Y\), where \(0 \leq X<2^{64}\) and \(0 \leq Y<2^{64}\). Since \(X\) and \(Y\) can be represented as 64-bit words \(x\) and \(y\), respectively, the integer \(Z\) can be represented as the pair of words ( \(x, y\) ). This property is used for SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.\\
4. For the secure hash algorithms, the size of the message block - \(m\) bits - depends on the algorithm.\\
a) For SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256, each message block has 512 bits, which are represented as a sequence of sixteen 32 -bit words.\\
b) For SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 each message block has 1024 bits, which are represented as a sequence of sixteen 64 -bit words.

\subsection*{3.2 Operations on Words}
The following operations are applied to \(w\)-bit words in all five secure hash algorithms. SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 operate on 32-bit words ( \(w=32\) ), and SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA512/224 and SHA-512/256 operate on 64-bit words ( \(w=64\) ).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Bitwise logical word operations: \(\wedge, \vee, \oplus\), and \(\neg\) (see Sec. 2.2.2).
  \item Addition modulo \(2^{w}\).
\end{enumerate}

The operation \(x+y\) is defined as follows. The words \(x\) and \(y\) represent integers \(X\) and \(Y\), where \(0 \leq X<2^{w}\) and \(0 \leq Y<2^{w}\). For positive integers \(U\) and \(V\), let \(U \bmod V\) be the remainder upon dividing \(U\) by \(V\). Compute

\[
Z=(X+Y) \bmod 2^{w} .
\]

Then \(0 \leq Z<2^{w}\). Convert the integer \(Z\) to a word, \(z\), and define \(z=x+y\).\\
3. The right shift operation \(\boldsymbol{S H R}^{\boldsymbol{n}}(\boldsymbol{x})\), where \(x\) is a \(w\)-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with 0 \(\leq n<w\), is defined by

\[
S H R^{n}(x)=x \gg n .
\]

This operation is used in the SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 algorithms.\\
4. The rotate right (circular right shift) operation \(\boldsymbol{R O T R}{ }^{n}(x)\), where \(x\) is a w-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with \(0 \leq n<w\), is defined by

\[
\operatorname{ROTR}^{n}(x)=(x \gg n) \vee(x \ll w-n) .
\]

Thus, \(\operatorname{ROTR}^{n}(x)\) is equivalent to a circular shift (rotation) of \(x\) by \(n\) positions to the right.

This operation is used by the SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA512/224 and SHA-512/256 algorithms.\\
5. The rotate left (circular left shift) operation, \(\boldsymbol{R O T L}^{n}(\boldsymbol{x})\), where \(x\) is a \(w\)-bit word and \(n\) is an integer with \(0 \leq n<w\), is defined by

\[
\operatorname{ROTL}^{n}(x)=(x \ll n) \vee(x \gg w-n) .
\]

Thus, \(\operatorname{ROTL}^{n}(x)\) is equivalent to a circular shift (rotation) of \(x\) by \(n\) positions to the left.

This operation is used only in the SHA-1 algorithm.\\
6. Note the following equivalence relationships, where \(w\) is fixed in each relationship:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{ROTL}^{n}(x) \approx \operatorname{ROTR}^{w-n}(x) \\
& \operatorname{ROTR}^{n}(x) \approx \operatorname{ROTL}^{\omega-n}(x)
\end{aligned}
\]

\section*{4. FUNCTIONS AND CONSTANTS}
\subsection*{4.1 Functions}
This section defines the functions that are used by each of the algorithms. Although the SHA224, SHA-256, SHA-384,SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 algorithms all use similar functions, their descriptions are separated into sections for SHA-224 and SHA-256 (Sec. 4.1.2) and for SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 (Sec. 4.1.3), since the input and output for these functions are words of different sizes. Each of the algorithms include \(\operatorname{Ch}(x, y, z)\) and \(\operatorname{Maj}(x, y, z)\) functions; the exclusive-OR operation \((\oplus)\) in these functions may be replaced by a bitwise OR operation ( \(\vee\) ) and produce identical results.

\subsection*{4.1.1 SHA-1 Functions}
SHA-1 uses a sequence of logical functions, \(f_{0}, f_{1}, \ldots, f_{79}\). Each function \(f_{\mathrm{t}}\), where \(0 \leq t \leq 79\), operates on three 32-bit words, \(x, y\), and \(z\), and produces a 32-bit word as output. The function \(f_{t}\) \((x, y, z)\) is defined as follows:

\[
f_{t}(x, y, z)= \begin{cases}\operatorname{Ch}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(\neg x \wedge z) & 0 \leq t \leq 19 \\ \operatorname{Parity}(x, y, z)=x \oplus y \oplus z & 20 \leq t \leq 39 \\ \operatorname{Maj}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(x \wedge z) \oplus(y \wedge z) & 40 \leq t \leq 59 \\ \operatorname{Parity}(x, y, z)=x \oplus y \oplus z & 60 \leq t \leq 79\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{4.1.2 SHA-224 and SHA-256 Functions}
SHA-224 and SHA-256 both use six logical functions, where each function operates on 32-bit words, which are represented as \(x, y\), and \(z\). The result of each function is a new 32-bit word.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{Ch}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(\neg x \wedge z) \\
& \operatorname{Maj}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(x \wedge z) \oplus(y \wedge z) \\
& \sum_{0}^{\{256\}}(x)=\operatorname{ROTR}^{2}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{13}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{22}(x) \\
& \sum_{1}^{\{256\}}(x)=\operatorname{ROTR}^{6}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{11}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{25}(x) \\
& \sigma_{0}^{\{256\}}(x)=\operatorname{ROTR}^{7}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{18}(x) \oplus \operatorname{SHR}^{3}(x) \\
& \sigma_{1}^{\{256\}}(x)=\operatorname{ROTR}^{17}(x) \oplus \operatorname{ROTR}^{19}(x) \oplus \operatorname{SHR}^{10}(x)
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{4.1.3 SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 Functions}
SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 use six logical functions, where each function operates on 64-bit words, which are represented as \(x, y\), and \(z\). The result of each function is a new 64-bit word.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \operatorname{Ch}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(\neg x \wedge z) \\
& \operatorname{Maj}(x, y, z)=(x \wedge y) \oplus(x \wedge z) \oplus(y \wedge z) \\

\section*{5. PREPROCESSING}
Preprocessing consists of three steps: padding the message, \(M\) (Sec. 5.1), parsing the message into message blocks (Sec. 5.2), and setting the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\) (Sec. 5.3).

\subsection*{5.1 Padding the Message}
The purpose of this padding is to ensure that the padded message is a multiple of 512 or 1024 bits, depending on the algorithm. Padding can be inserted before hash computation begins on a message, or at any other time during the hash computation prior to processing the block(s) that will contain the padding.

\subsection*{5.1.1 SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256}
Suppose that the length of the message, \(M\), is \(\ell\) bits. Append the bit " 1 " to the end of the message, followed by \(k\) zero bits, where \(k\) is the smallest, non-negative solution to the equation \(\ell+1+k \equiv 448 \bmod 512\). Then append the 64 -bit block that is equal to the number \(\ell\) expressed using a binary representation. For example, the (8-bit ASCII) message "abc" has length \(8 \times 3=24\), so the message is padded with a one bit, then \(448-(24+1)=423\) zero bits, and then the message length, to become the 512-bit padded message\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_07_9c328d09069db93254c0g-18}

The length of the padded message should now be a multiple of 512 bits.

\subsection*{5.1.2 SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256}
Suppose the length of the message \(M\), in bits, is \(\ell\) bits. Append the bit " 1 " to the end of the message, followed by \(k\) zero bits, where \(k\) is the smallest non-negative solution to the equation \(\ell+1+k \equiv 896 \bmod 1024\). Then append the 128 -bit block that is equal to the number \(\ell\) expressed using a binary representation. For example, the (8-bit ASCII) message "abc" has length \(8 \times 3=24\), so the message is padded with a one bit, then \(896-(24+1)=871\) zero bits, and then the message length, to become the 1024-bit padded message\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_07_9c328d09069db93254c0g-18(1)}

The length of the padded message should now be a multiple of 1024 bits.

\subsection*{5.2 Parsing the Message}
The message and its padding must be parsed into \(N m\)-bit blocks.

\subsection*{5.2.1 SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256}
For SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256, the message and its padding are parsed into \(N\) 512-bit blocks, \(M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}, \ldots, M^{(N)}\). Since the 512 bits of the input block may be expressed as sixteen 32bit words, the first 32 bits of message block \(i\) are denoted \(M_{0}^{(i)}\), the next 32 bits are \(M_{1}^{(i)}\), and so on up to \(M_{15}^{(i)}\).

\subsection*{5.2.2 SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256}
For SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, the message and its padding are parsed into \(N\) 1024-bit blocks, \(M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}, \ldots, M^{(N)}\). Since the 1024 bits of the input block may be expressed as sixteen 64-bit words, the first 64 bits of message block \(i\) are denoted \(M_{0}^{(i)}\), the next 64 bits are \(M_{1}^{(i)}\), and so on up to \(M_{15}^{(i)}\).

\subsection*{5.3 Setting the Initial Hash Value ( \(H^{(0)}\) )}
Before hash computation begins for each of the secure hash algorithms, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), must be set. The size and number of words in \(H^{(0)}\) depends on the message digest size.

\subsection*{5.3.1 SHA-1}
For SHA-1, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following five 32-bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}^{(0)} & =67452301 \\
H_{1}^{(0)} & =\text { efcdab89 } \\
H_{2}^{(0)} & =98 \mathrm{badcfe} \\
H_{3}^{(0)} & =10325476 \\
H_{4}^{(0)} & =\mathrm{c} 3 \mathrm{~d} 2 \mathrm{e} 1 \mathrm{f0}
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{5.3.2 SHA-224}

H_{6}^{(0)} & =64 \mathrm{f} 98 \mathrm{fa7}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
H_{7}^{(0)}=\text { befa } 4 \mathrm{fa} 4
\]

\subsection*{5.3.3 SHA-256}
For SHA-256, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following eight 32-bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}^{(0)} & =6 \mathrm{a} 09 \mathrm{e} 667 \\
H_{1}^{(0)} & =\mathrm{b} b 67 \mathrm{ae} 85 \\
H_{2}^{(0)} & =3 \mathrm{c} 6 \mathrm{ef} 372 \\
H_{3}^{(0)} & =\mathrm{a} 54 \mathrm{ff} 53 \mathrm{a} \\
H_{4}^{(0)} & =510 \mathrm{e} 527 \mathrm{f} \\
H_{5}^{(0)} & =9 \mathrm{~b} 05688 \mathrm{c} \\
H_{6}^{(0)} & =1 \mathrm{f} 83 \mathrm{~d} 9 \mathrm{ab} \\
H_{7}^{(0)} & =5 \mathrm{be} 0 \mathrm{~cd} 19
\end{aligned}
\]

These words were obtained by taking the first thirty-two bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first eight prime numbers.

\subsection*{5.3.4 SHA-384}
For SHA-384, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following eight 64-bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& H_{0}^{(0)}=\text { cbbb } 9 \mathrm{~d} 5 \mathrm{dc} 1059 \mathrm{ed} 8 \\
& H_{1}^{(0)}=629 \mathrm{a} 292 \mathrm{a} 367 \mathrm{~cd} 507 \\
& H_{2}^{(0)}=9159015 \mathrm{a} 3070 \mathrm{dd} 17 \\
& H_{3}^{(0)}=152 \mathrm{fecd} 8 \mathrm{f} 70 \mathrm{e} 5939 \\
& H_{4}^{(0)}=67332667 \mathrm{ffc} 00 \mathrm{~b} 31 \\

& H_{7}^{(0)}=47 \mathrm{~b} 5481 \mathrm{dbefa} 4 \mathrm{fa} 4
\end{aligned}
\]

These words were obtained by taking the first sixty-four bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the ninth through sixteenth prime numbers.

\subsection*{5.3.5 SHA-512}
For SHA-512, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following eight 64 -bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& H_{0}^{(0)}=6 \mathrm{a} 09 \mathrm{e} 667 \mathrm{f} 3 \mathrm{bcc} 908 \\
& H_{1}^{(0)}=\mathrm{b} b 67 \mathrm{ae} 8584 \mathrm{caa} 73 \mathrm{~b}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{2}^{(0)} & =3 \mathrm{c} 6 \mathrm{ef} 372 \mathrm{fe} 94 \mathrm{f} 82 \mathrm{~b} \\

H_{7}^{(0)} & =5 \mathrm{be} 0 \mathrm{~cd} 19137 \mathrm{e} 2179
\end{aligned}
\]

These words were obtained by taking the first sixty-four bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first eight prime numbers.

\subsection*{5.3.6 SHA-512/t}
"SHA-512/t" is the general name for a \(t\)-bit hash function based on SHA-512 whose output is truncated to \(t\) bits. Each hash function requires a distinct initial hash value. This section provides a procedure for determining the initial value for SHA-512/ \(t\) for a given value of \(t\).

For SHA-512/t, \(t\) is any positive integer without a leading zero such that \(t<512\), and \(t\) is not 384 . For example: \(t\) is 256 , but not 0256 , and "SHA-512/t" is "SHA-512/256" (an 11 character long ASCII string), which is equivalent to 534841 2D 353132 2F 323536 in hexadecimal.

The initial hash value for SHA-512/t, for a given value of \(t\), shall be generated by the SHA-512/t IV Generation Function below.

\section*{SHA-512/t IV Generation Function}
(begin:)\\
Denote \(H^{(0)^{\prime}}\) to be the initial hash value of SHA-512 as specified in Section 5.3.5 above.\\
Denote \(H^{(0)^{\prime \prime}}\) to be the initial hash value computed below.\\
\(H^{(0)}\) is the IV for SHA-512/t.

\begin{verbatim}
For \(i=0\) to 7
    \{
        \(H_{i}^{(0)^{\prime \prime}}=H_{i}^{(0)^{\prime}} \oplus\) a5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5(in hex).
    \}
\end{verbatim}

\(H^{(0)}=\) SHA-512 ("SHA-512/t") using \(H^{(0) "}\) as the IV, where \(t\) is the specific truncation value.\\
(end.)

SHA-512/224 \((t=224)\) and SHA-512/256 \((t=256)\) are approved hash algorithms. Other SHA\(512 / t\) hash algorithms with different \(t\) values may be specified in [SP 800-107] in the future as the need arises. Below are the IVs for SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.

\subsection*{5.3.6.1 SHA-512/224}
For SHA-512/224, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following eight 64-bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}^{(0)} & =8 \mathrm{C} 3 \mathrm{D} 37 \mathrm{C} 819544 \mathrm{DA} 2 \\
H_{1}^{(0)} & =73 \mathrm{E} 1996689 \mathrm{DCD} 4 \mathrm{D} 6 \\
H_{2}^{(0)} & =1 \mathrm{DFAB} 7 \mathrm{AE} 32 \mathrm{FF} 9 \mathrm{C} 82 \\

H_{7}^{(0)} & =1112 \mathrm{E} 6 \mathrm{AD} 91 \mathrm{D} 692 \mathrm{~A} 1
\end{aligned}
\]

These words were obtained by executing the SHA-512/t IV Generation Function with \(t=224\).

\subsection*{5.3.6.2 SHA-512/256}
For SHA-512/256, the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall consist of the following eight 64 -bit words, in hex:

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}^{(0)} & =22312194 \mathrm{FC} 2 \mathrm{BF} 72 \mathrm{C} \\

H_{7}^{(0)} & =0 \mathrm{~EB} 72 \mathrm{DDC} 81 \mathrm{C} 52 \mathrm{CA} 2
\end{aligned}
\]

These words were obtained by executing the SHA-512/t IV Generation Function with \(t=256\).

\section*{6. SECURE HASH ALGORITHMS}
In the following sections, the hash algorithms are not described in ascending order of size. SHA256 is described before SHA-224 because the specification for SHA-224 is identical to SHA256, except that different initial hash values are used, and the final hash value is truncated to 224 bits for SHA-224. The same is true for SHA-512, SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, except that the final hash value is truncated to 224 bits for SHA-512/224, 256 bits for SHA\(512 / 256\) or 384 bits for SHA-384.

For each of the secure hash algorithms, there may exist alternate computation methods that yield identical results; one example is the alternative SHA-1 computation described in Sec. 6.1.3. Such alternate methods may be implemented in conformance to this standard.

\subsection*{6.1 SHA-1}
SHA-1 may be used to hash a message, \(M\), having a length of \(\ell\) bits, where \(0 \leq \ell<2^{64}\). The algorithm uses 1) a message schedule of eighty 32 -bit words, 2) five working variables of 32 bits each, and 3) a hash value of five 32-bit words. The final result of SHA-1 is a 160 -bit message digest.

The words of the message schedule are labeled \(W_{0}, W_{1}, \ldots, W_{79}\). The five working variables are labeled \(\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}, \boldsymbol{d}\), and \(\boldsymbol{e}\). The words of the hash value are labeled \(H_{0}^{(i)}, H_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots, H_{4}^{(i)}\), which will hold the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), replaced by each successive intermediate hash value (after each message block is processed), \(H^{(i)}\), and ending with the final hash value, \(H^{(N)}\). SHA-1 also uses a single temporary word, \(T\).

\subsection*{6.1.1 SHA-1 Preprocessing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), as specified in Sec. 5.3.1.
  \item The message is padded and parsed as specified in Section 5.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{6.1.2 SHA-1 Hash Computation}
The SHA-1 hash computation uses functions and constants previously defined in Sec. 4.1.1 and Sec. 4.2.1, respectively. Addition (+) is performed modulo \(2^{32}\).

Each message block, \(M^{(1)}, M^{(2)}, \ldots, M^{(N)}\), is processed in order, using the following steps:

For \(i=1\) to \(N\) :\\
\{

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prepare the message schedule, \(\left\{W_{t}\right\}\) :
\end{enumerate}

\[
W_{t}= \begin{cases}M_{t}^{(i)} & 0 \leq t \leq 15 \\ R O T L^{1}\left(W_{t-3} \oplus W_{t-8} \oplus W_{t-14} \oplus W_{t-16}\right) & 16 \leq t \leq 79\end{cases}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item Initialize the five working variables, \(\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}, \boldsymbol{d}\), and \(\boldsymbol{e}\), with the \((i-1)^{\text {st }}\) hash value:
\end{enumerate}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& a=H_{0}^{(i-1)} \\
& b=H_{1}^{(i-1)} \\
& c=H_{2}^{(i-1)} \\
& d=H_{3}^{(i-1)} \\
& e=H_{4}^{(i-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item For \(t=0\) to 79 :\\
\{
\end{enumerate}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& T=R O T L^{5}(a)+f_{t}(b, c, d)+e+K_{t}+W_{t} \\
& e=d \\
& d=c \\
& c=R O T L^{30}(b) \\
& b=a \\
& a=T
\end{aligned}
\]

\}\\
4. Compute the \(i^{\text {th }}\) intermediate hash value \(H^{(i)}\) :

\[
\begin{aligned}
& H_{0}^{(i)}=a+H_{0}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{1}^{(i)}=b+H_{1}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{2}^{(i)}=c+H_{2}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{3}^{(i)}=d+H_{3}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{4}^{(i)}=e+H_{4}^{(i-1)}

After repeating steps one through four a total of \(N\) times (i.e., after processing \(M^{(N)}\) ), the resulting 160-bit message digest of the message, \(M\), is

\]

\subsection*{6.1.3 Alternate Method for Computing a SHA-1 Message Digest}
The SHA-1 hash computation method described in Sec. 6.1.2 assumes that the message schedule \(W_{0}, W_{1}, \ldots, W_{79}\) is implemented as an array of eighty 32-bit words. This is efficient from the standpoint of the minimization of execution time, since the addresses of \(W_{t-3}, \ldots, \mathrm{~W}_{t-16}\) in step (2) of Sec. 6.1.2 are easily computed.

However, if memory is limited, an alternative is to regard \(\left\{W_{t}\right\}\) as a circular queue that may be implemented using an array of sixteen 32-bit words, \(W_{0}, W_{1}, \ldots, W_{15}\). The alternate method that is described in this section yields the same message digest as the SHA-1 computation method described in Sec. 6.1.2. Although this alternate method saves sixty-four 32-bit words of storage, it is likely to lengthen the execution time due to the increased complexity of the address computations for the \(\left\{W_{t}\right\}\) in step (3).

For this alternate SHA-1 method, let MASK=0000000£ (in hex). As in Sec. 6.1.1, addition is performed modulo \(2^{32}\). Assuming that the preprocessing as described in Sec. 6.1.1 has been performed, the processing of \(M^{(i)}\) is as follows:

For \(i=1\) to \(N\) :\\
\{

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For \(t=0\) to 15 :\\
\(\square\)
\end{enumerate}

\[
W_{t}=M_{t}^{(i)}
\]

\}\\
2. Initialize the five working variables, \(\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}, \boldsymbol{d}\), and \(\boldsymbol{e}\), with the \((i-1)^{\text {st }}\) hash value:

\[
\begin{aligned}
& a=H_{0}^{(i-1)} \\
& b=H_{1}^{(i-1)} \\
& c=H_{2}^{(i-1)} \\
& d=H_{3}^{(i-1)} \\
& e=H_{4}^{(i-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item For \(t=0\) to 79 :\\
\{
\end{enumerate}

\[
s=t \wedge M A S K
\]

If \(t \geq 16\) then\\
\{

\[
W_{s}=\operatorname{ROTL}^{1}\left(W_{(s+13) \wedge M A S K} \oplus W_{(s+8) \wedge M A S K} \oplus W_{(s+2) \wedge M A S K} \oplus W_{s}\right)
\]

\}\\
\(T=\operatorname{ROTL}^{5}(a)+f_{t}(b, c, d)+e+K_{t}+W_{s}\)\\
\(e=d\)\\
\(d=c\)\\
\(c=\operatorname{ROTL}^{30}(b)\)\\
\(b=a\)\\
\(a=T\)\\
\}\\
4. Compute the \(i^{\text {th }}\) intermediate hash value \(H^{(i)}\) :

\[
\begin{aligned}
& H_{0}^{(i)}=a+H_{0}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{1}^{(i)}=b+H_{1}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{2}^{(i)}=c+H_{2}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{3}^{(i)}=d+H_{3}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{4}^{(i)}=e+H_{4}^{(i-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

After repeating steps one through four a total of \(N\) times (i.e., after processing \(M^{(N)}\) ), the resulting 160 -bit message digest of the message, \(M\), is

\[
H_{0}^{(N)}\left\|H_{1}^{(N)}\right\| H_{2}^{(N)}\left\|H_{3}^{(N)}\right\| H_{4}^{(N)}
\]

\subsection*{6.2 SHA-256}
SHA-256 may be used to hash a message, \(M\), having a length of \(\ell\) bits, where \(0 \leq \ell<2^{64}\). The algorithm uses 1) a message schedule of sixty-four 32-bit words, 2) eight working variables of 32 bits each, and 3) a hash value of eight 32-bit words. The final result of SHA-256 is a 256 -bit message digest.

The words of the message schedule are labeled \(W_{0}, W_{1}, \ldots, W_{63}\). The eight working variables are labeled \(\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}, \boldsymbol{d}, \boldsymbol{e}, \boldsymbol{f}, \boldsymbol{g}\), and \(\boldsymbol{h}\). The words of the hash value are labeled \(H_{0}^{(i)}, H_{1}^{(i)}, \ldots, H_{7}^{(i)}\), which will hold the initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), replaced by each successive intermediate hash value\\
(after each message block is processed), \(H^{(i)}\), and ending with the final hash value, \(H^{(N)}\). SHA256 also uses two temporary words, \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\).

\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item Initialize the eight working variables, \(\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{c}, \boldsymbol{d}, \boldsymbol{e}, \boldsymbol{f}, \boldsymbol{g}\), and \(\boldsymbol{h}\), with the (i-1) \({ }^{\text {st }}\) hash value:

& h=H_{7}^{(i-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item For \(t=0\) to 63 :\\
\{
\end{enumerate}

\[
\begin{aligned}
& T_{1}=h+\sum_{1}^{\{256\}}(e)+C h(e, f, g)+K_{t}^{\{256\}}+W_{t} \\

& h=g \\
& g=f \\
& f=e \\

4. Compute the \(i^{\text {th }}\) intermediate hash value \(H^{(i)}\) :

\[

& H_{6}^{(i)}=g+H_{6}^{(i-1)} \\
& H_{7}^{(i)}=h+H_{7}^{(i-1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

After repeating steps one through four a total of \(N\) times (i.e., after processing \(M^{(N)}\) ), the resulting 256-bit message digest of the message, \(M\), is

\[

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The initial hash value, \(H^{(0)}\), shall be set as specified in Sec. 5.3.2; and
  \item The 224-bit message digest is obtained by truncating the final hash value, \(H(N)\), to its left-most 224 bits:
\end{enumerate}

\[
H_{0}^{(N)}\left\|H_{1}^{(N)}\right\| H_{2}^{(N)}\left\|H_{3}^{(N)}\right\| H_{4}^{(N)}\left\|H_{5}^{(N)}\right\| H_{6}^{(N)}

\subsection*{6.4 SHA-512}

The algorithm uses 1) a message schedule of eighty 64-bit words, 2) eight working variables of 64 bits each, and 3) a hash value of eight 64-bit words. The final result of SHA-512 is a 512-bit message digest.

\section*{7. TRUNCATION OF A MESSAGE DIGEST}
Some application may require a hash function with a message digest length different than those provided by the hash functions in this Standard. In such cases, a truncated message digest may be used, whereby a hash function with a larger message digest length is applied to the data to be hashed, and the resulting message digest is truncated by selecting an appropriate number of the leftmost bits. For guidelines on choosing the length of the truncated message digest and information about its security implications for the cryptographic application that uses it, see SP 800-107 [SP 800-107].
